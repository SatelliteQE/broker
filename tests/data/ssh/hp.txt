I sing of thee, oh Hushpuppy, delight,
A golden morsel, crispy, warm, and bright.
From humble cornmeal, a treasure you rise,
Deep-fried to perfection, a joy to the eyes.

Your fluffy heart, a cloud of pure bliss,
Melts on the tongue with a savory kiss.
Sweet onion whispers, a hint of the South,
A taste that evokes a welcoming mouth.

You grace the table, beside fish or fowl,
A sidekick so loyal, a culinary jewel.
With barbecue's smoke or creamy chowder,
You stand as a friend, a taste to empower.

More than a fritter, a comfort you bring,
A memory of childhood, a joy that you sing.
In every golden nugget, a story untold,
Of family gatherings, and laughter of old.

So hail, Hushpuppy, king of the side,
A culinary hero, in whom we confide.
May your legacy linger, a taste that inspires,
A golden delight, setting tastebuds on fire!
